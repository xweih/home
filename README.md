Hi! I'm Xiaowei. I'm a passionate Operations Research Data Scientist with expertise in mathematical optimization, data analytics, and their applications in operations management. Below are some highlights of my work.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Last Mile Delivery (LMD) Scheduling](https://github.com/xweih/Last-Mile-Delivery)

Furniture Co‚Äôs logistic department makes the last mile delivery from store to customers. I generate an assignment schedule for a given day by showing "what employee delivers which furniture to where" | visualized

### Project 2: [Tackling the Pandemic Supply Chain Disruption](https://github.com/xweih/POSTER--A-trident-for-the-resource-scarcity-and-supply-chain-disruption/blob/main/images/XHposter.png)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical glove supply chain was under stress with constant shortages. How should policymakers administer proper economic instruments to relieve the supply chain stress? 

### Project 3: [The King Crab Hack (KCH 2.0)](https://github.com/xweih/kcs_2.0)

An analytical guide to seafood-boil orders using Mixed Integer Optimization and CVXPY

### Project 4: [The Space Walker](https://github.com/xweih/spacewalker)

An astronaut's spacewalk scheduling for satellite repairs: a capacitated TSP with lateness requirements | visualized

### Project 5: [Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/xweih/portfolioOpt)

An application of constrained convex optimization in finance with a Regularized Mean-Variance Model | visualized

### Project 6: [Titanic Visualization](https://xweih.github.io/titanic/)

### Project 7: [Iris Visualization](https://xweih.github.io/iris/)

### Project 8: [Outlier Remover](https://github.com/xweih/OutlierRemover)

A routine that removes the outliers of a dataset until there is none left.
